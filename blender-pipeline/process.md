> **Status:** Stub — implementation pending

## Overview

3-phase pipeline process from structured prompt to exported 3D assets with iterative quality refinement.

## Phases

1. **Interpretation** — Parse prompt into asset specification
2. **Generation** — Build scene, geometry, materials, lighting
3. **Quality & Export** — Inspect, refine, and export production assets
