## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Skill Pack Management (specify your registry URL or set SPECTREE_REGISTRY_URL)
spectree list --registry https://your-spectree-instance.com
spectree install @spectree/full --registry https://your-spectree-instance.com
spectree update --all --registry https://your-spectree-instance.com

# Or set the env var once to avoid repeating --registry:
export SPECTREE_REGISTRY_URL=https://your-spectree-instance.com
spectree install @spectree/full    # Uses SPECTREE_REGISTRY_URL

# SpecTree MCP Tools (in GitHub Copilot)
@spectree list epics               # List your epics
@spectree create epic              # Create epic interactively
@spectree get progress <epic-id>   # Check epic progress
```

### Common Patterns

**Planning Pattern:**
1. Describe requirement in natural language
2. Run `@planner` to decompose into epic
3. Review and adjust in SpecTree UI
4. Start implementation

**Implementation Pattern:**
1. Create feature with tasks
2. Add structured descriptions with AI instructions
3. Set execution order and dependencies
4. Use worker agent to implement
5. Validate with acceptance criteria

**Review Pattern:**
1. Complete implementation work
2. Run `@reviewer` agent
3. Review feedback and suggested changes
4. Apply fixes
5. Re-run validation
