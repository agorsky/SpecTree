# What's New

This directory contains release notes for Dispatcher versions.

## Purpose

The What's New documentation provides:
- **Version history** — Chronological record of all releases
- **Feature announcements** — New capabilities added in each version
- **Breaking changes** — Important changes that require user action
- **Bug fixes** — Issues resolved in each release
- **Migration guides** — Instructions for upgrading between versions

## File Naming Convention

Release notes follow the naming pattern: `vX.Y.Z.md`

- **Format:** `v` prefix + semantic version + `.md` extension
- **Examples:**
  - `v0.1.0.md` — Initial release (0.1.0)
  - `v0.2.0.md` — Minor version with new features (0.2.0)
  - `v0.2.1.md` — Patch version with bug fixes (0.2.1)
  - `v1.0.0.md` — Major version (1.0.0)

### Version Number Format

Dispatcher follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR:** Breaking changes or incompatible API changes
- **MINOR:** New features in a backwards-compatible manner
- **PATCH:** Backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Markdown Structure Template

Each release note file should follow this standard structure:

```markdown

**Release Date:** [Month Year]

## Version Source of Truth

The application version is always defined in `package.json` at the repository root:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0"
}
```

Release notes MUST match the version in `package.json`. See `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` for full versioning details.
