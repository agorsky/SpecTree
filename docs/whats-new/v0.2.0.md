# Version 0.2.0

**Release Date:** February 2026

## Overview

Version 0.2.0 focuses on reliability improvements for AI session monitoring and accuracy fixes for Activity Dashboard metrics and drill-down navigation.

## Features

### AI Session Monitoring
- **Session event service layer** — Added a dedicated API service for session event retrieval and aggregation.
- **Expanded session event APIs** — Added stronger route/schema coverage for event streams and timeline data.
- **Shared event typing improvements** — Expanded shared session event types for stronger API/frontend consistency.
- **Frontend session event hooks** — Replaced legacy progress polling with new event-driven hooks for session activity data.

### Activity Dashboard
- **Timezone-resilient interval bucketing** — Improved date bucket generation for day/week/month metrics across timezones and DST transitions.
- **Decision drill-down navigation** — Epic-level decisions now link directly to their epic when no feature context is present.
- **Task drill-down navigation** — Task metric rows now route to task detail pages.

## Improvements

- **Task attribution for My Activity** — Task completion metrics now support legacy attribution fallback (`implementedBy` first, fallback to `createdBy` when missing).
- **Progress event attribution** — Progress start/complete flows now propagate authenticated user identity into status-change attribution.
- **Dashboard detail rendering** — Task completion timestamps are now null-safe in API responses and UI rendering.

## Bug Fixes

- **Tasks Completed showing 0 in My Activity** — Fixed attribution mismatch that caused completed task counts to appear as zero.
- **Invalid date rendering in task drill-down** — Incomplete tasks now render as `Not completed` instead of producing invalid date output.
- **DST boundary metric drift** — Fixed bucket boundary handling during DST transitions to avoid off-by-one day/week counts.

## Technical Details

- Added dedicated session event service and tests in API package.
- Added integration and service test coverage for session events.
- Added DST-focused tests for user activity aggregation.
- Updated web session monitor components to consume the new session event data path.

## Breaking Changes

None.

## Migration Notes

- No manual migration required for end users.
- Developers should rebuild and redeploy both API and web packages to pick up the new event APIs and dashboard behavior.
